To resolve this, carefully examine your package.json and ensure that all your dependencies are compatible with your current React Native version. If you have conflicting dependencies, consider these options:

1. **Version Pinning:** Specify exact versions of your packages in package.json to eliminate version conflicts. For instance, replace `"react-native-library": "^1.0.0"` with `"react-native-library": "1.0.0"`.
2. **Dependency Resolution Tools:** Tools such as `npm-check-updates` and `yarn upgrade-interactive` can help identify and upgrade outdated or conflicting dependencies.
3. **Check Library Compatibility:** Verify that the third-party libraries you're using explicitly support the version of React Native in your project. Check the library's documentation or GitHub page for compatibility information.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve inconsistencies. Delete your node_modules folder, run `npm install` (or `yarn install`), and then rebuild your application.
5. **Use React Native Debugger:** The debugger can help pin point the specific location of the error. Example code demonstrating the use of react-native-debugger is available in the bug.js file.
