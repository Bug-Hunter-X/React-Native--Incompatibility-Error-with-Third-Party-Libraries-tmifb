This repository demonstrates a common React Native issue: incompatibility between third-party libraries.  The `bug.js` file shows how including conflicting library versions leads to crashes or unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` provides a resolution by managing dependencies efficiently, such as by using a compatible version or resolving dependency conflicts using techniques like version pinning or using a dependency resolution tool.
