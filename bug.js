This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that is not compatible with the latest version of React Native or when you have conflicting dependencies in your project.  For example, if library A depends on React Native version X, and library B depends on React Native version Y (where X != Y), you'll run into this. This might also happen if there are inconsistencies between the native modules and the JavaScript code. Symptoms could include unexpected crashes, blank screens, or build failures.
